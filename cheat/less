-i or --ignore-case (really a smartcase)
-R or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS
-S or --chop-long-lines
-F or --quit-if-one-screen
-X or --no-init Disables sending the termcap initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal.

kitty needs less to NOT have the -X because otherwise the scrollwheel does not
work in less, therefore also -F cannot be used because without -X a single page
result wold quit and ALSO clear the screen showing nothing.
