# Setting class_maps_only: false would fail because if you also add a section like:
#  "autoload": {
#    "files": [
#      "../$path_to_web/core/includes/bootstrap.inc"
#    ]
#  },
# to "$DOTFILESREPO/chezmoi_ignored/phpactor/composer.json"
# to load funcs like t, drupal_static, ... 
# it would actually make phpactor require that file during its runtime and that file has,
# at the time of this writing, a line like this:
# class_alias('Drupal\Core\Http\KernelEvent', 'Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Event\KernelEvent', TRUE)
# which would trigger phpactor's own autoloader to look for the Symfony Event class
# which it does not have.
