2/3 DOTS, log
- `r1..r2  = ^r1 r2`                                    Means set difference, all commits reachable from r2 - all commits reachable from r1.
- `r1...r2 = r1 r2 --not $(git merge-base --all r1 r2)` Means all commits reachable from either r1 or r2 - all commits which are in common. Less useful, more commits.
2/3 DOTS, diff
- `r1..r2  = r1 r2`                               Simple diff between two shas.
- `r1...r2 = git diff $(git-merge-base r1 r2) r2` Diff between r2 and common ancestor. Useful for getting net diff of a feature branch wrt a base branch that has evolved.
